### Issue: Notifications not sending
**Solution**: Show WhatsApp fallback feature instead

### Issue: Slow loading
**Solution**: Have screenshots ready as backup

### Issue: Firebase connection issues
**Solution**: Use cached data demonstration

### Issue: Timer not working in demo
**Solution**: Use manual SOS trigger instead

## üì± Screenshots for Backup

Keep these screenshots ready in case of technical difficulties:

1. Login screen with OTP verification
2. Home dashboard with safety status

7. PWA install prompt

## üé§ Q&A Preparation

Common questions and prepared answers:

**Q: How accurate is the location tracking?**
A: GPS accuracy is typically 3-5 meters, with updates every 10-15 seconds during active trips.

**Q: What happens if there's no internet?**
A: The PWA caches essential functions offline. When connection returns, all data syncs automatically.

**Q: Is user data secure?**
A: Yes, we use Firebase security rules, HTTPS encryption, and store minimal data. Location is only tracked during active trips.

**Q: Can this scale to multiple cities?**
A: Absolutely. Firebase handles scaling automatically, and our geohash clustering works globally.

**Q: How does the guardian notification work technically?**
A: Firebase Cloud Functions trigger push notifications to all guardian devices when incidents are created.

## üöÄ Post-Demo Next Steps

After a successful demo:

1. **Collect feedback** on specific features
2. **Share GitHub repository** for technical review
3. **Provide deployment instructions** for testing
4. **Schedule follow-up** for detailed technical discussion
5. **Gather contact information** for future updates

---

**Demo Tip**: Practice this script multiple times to stay within 90 seconds while hitting all key points. Have a co-presenter handle the guardian view on a second device for more impactful emergency demonstrations.
